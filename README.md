# Seefood: Hotdog, Not Hotdog
## Overview
This project is inspired by the fictional app Seefood created on HBO's Silicon Valley. 
The idea of the app is to work as a simple image classifier to identify an image as either a hotdog or not a hotdog. 
This attempt at classification is built using a 4-layer deep neural network with Relu Activation for the hidden layers and sigmoid for the classification output layer. 
The model is derived from an exercise in Andrew Ng's Neural Networks and Deep Learning course from deeplearning.ai. 
The dataset of hotdog images comes from https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/data
